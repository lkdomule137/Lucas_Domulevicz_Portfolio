## [Project 1: Classification of Amino Acids with a Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/lkdomule137/neural_network_classification_of_amino_acids)
### Overview:

### Highlights:
* Utilized TensorFlow and Sci-kit Learn in Python to build and optimize a deep neural network to classify 6 distinct amino acids based on spectroscopic and electrical data.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visual the data behavior in both the spectral and electrical domains
* Performed feature engineering and constructed a data processing pipeline on an imbalanced data set containing ~1,000 features, to improve model performance.
* The optimized model resulted in a balanced accuracy of ~72% on the test data set

## [Project 2: Identifying Single-Molecule Spectroscopic Signals](https://github.com/lkdomule137/kmeans_clustering_of_spectroscopic_data)
### Overview:


### Highlights:
* Compiled data electrical and spectral data from nearly 2 hours of times series measurements resulting in ~5,000 data points
* Performed preprocessing (background adjustment, filtering, normalization) and feature extraction on data consisting of ~1,000 features to prepare for modeling
* Used K-means clustering to separate background signals from those originating from a single-molecule and identify distinguishing features between the clusters
* Validated clustering model by constructing histograms of conductance data withheld from the model and comparing with independent data
* Analysis was part of a high-impact peer-reviewed research paper and featured as the [**BACK COVER ARTICLE**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202106779)
