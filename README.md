## [Project 1: Identifying Single-Molecule Spectroscopic Signals](https://github.com/lkdomule137/kmeans_clustering_of_spectroscopic_data)
### Overview:


### Highlights:
* Compiled data electrical and spectral data from nearly 2 hours of times series measurements resulting in ~5,000 data points
* Performed preprocessing (background adjustment, filtering, normalization) and feature extraction on data consisting of ~1,000 features to prepare for modeling
* Used K-means clustering to separate background signals from those originating from a single-molecule and identify distinguishing features between the clusters
* Validated clustering model by constructing histograms of conductance data withheld from the model and comparing with independent data
* Analysis was part of a high-impact peer-reviewed research paper and featured as the [**BACK COVER ARTICLE**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202106779)
